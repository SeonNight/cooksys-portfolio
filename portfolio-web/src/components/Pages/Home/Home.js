        <p>Hey there</p>
        <p>How are you today?</p>
        <p>I should introduce myself</p>
        <p>Hello, my name is Seong Kim</p>

        <p>What do you want to know?</p>

        <p>About You, Your Work, Are you an actual bird? Bye</p>

        <p>I am a computer developer with a love of the arts</p>
        <p>Mainly pictures and animations</p>
        <p>Was never that into theater</p>
        <p>When I was young I believed I was going to be an artist</p>
        <p>I would always draw pictures at home and in class</p>
        <p>Don't tell my teachers that</p>
        <p>That was how it was</p>
        <p>Until one bored day in math class</p>
        <p>Did you know, graphic calculators can be programed?</p>
        <p>Took me a couple minutes, but I made my first program</p>
        <p>Adding TWO numbers together</p>
        <p>I've made more</p>
        <p>*ahem* 'Useful'</p>
        <p>Programs on it since then</p>
        <p>And instead of going into college for art</p>
        <p>I graduated with a Bachleor's degree in Computer Science</p>
        <p>Still got an animation minor</p>
        <p>Just because I learned that I loved Computer Science doesn't mean I suddenly disliked art</p>

        <p>These are my previous projects and works</p>

        <p>Filing Sharing</p>
        <p>Simple command-line program</p>
        <p>You can send a file into a database</p>
        <p>With a password and amount of times it can be downloaded</p>
        <p>Social Media</p>
        <p>A pseudo twitter thingy</p>
        <p>No real front-end, but still works</p>
        <p>With user creation and deletion</p>
        <p>Posts, reposts, comments, likes, and such</p>
        <p>Developer Duel</p>
        <p>I like this one</p>
        <p>Using GitHub API, I got profile data of the name that was typed in</p>
        <p>You can also get two people and then let them battle each other</p>
        <p>And this one has actual front-end prettiness</p>

        <p>...(if looping again)</p>
        <p>No, this is just a simpler avatar to manipulate</p>
        <p>Okay, Are you sure you're not a bird?</p>
        <p>Yes, I am not a bird</p>
        <p>Okay, Really?</p>
        <p>Yes really</p>
        <p>Okay, Really? Really?</p>
        <p>I am not really a bird</p>
        <p>Okay, Really? Really? Really?</p>
        <p>I am NOT a bird</p>
        <p>Okay, Really? Really? Really? Really?</p>
        <p>I repeat, I am NOT a BIRD</p>
        <p>Okay, Really? Really? Really? Really? Reeaallllyy?</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>...</p>

        <p>Need to go?</p>
        <p>Well, I hope to see you soon</p>
        <p>So long!</p>
